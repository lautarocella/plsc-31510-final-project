# Short Description
This project analyzes the ideological differences between center-left and center-right coalitions in Chile from 1990 to 2021 using State of the Union presidential speeches. First, I scraped the Chilean Congress website to collect all speeches. Second, I cleaned and pre-processed the text. Third, I identified distinctive words for each coalition. Finally, I used Wordfish, an unsupervised learning method, to estimate ideological positions of texts, and visualized the results.
